== Notes ==

* The plugin makes a call to our server remotely to import Starter site content.

= Requirements =

* WordPress 4.7 or later.
* [Codegear Themes Official Themes](https://www.codegearthemes.com/wordpress).

== Installation ==

= Installation =

1. Install the plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server (in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory).
2. Activate the Codegear Starter plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Codegear Starter, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Codegear Starter" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our demo importer plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our demo importer plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this Codegear Starter plugin work with my theme? =

The starter sites are built using Acoustics, Cosme. We suggest picking your favourite and using that.

= Are there any FREE starter sites? =

You will get several FREE pre-made websites. There are many more premium starters that can be accessed when you purchase our PRO version.

= Can I import a starter site on an existing website? =

It is recommended to install and import a website demo on a fresh WordPress installation or a blank website to avoid overriding settings and page design. However, a page template can be imported on an existing website as well.

= Do I need to install any other plugin before importing a starter site? =

All you need to do is install the Codegear Starter plugin and select the website demo you wish to import. This step will install and activate the necessary plugins.

= Will you add more starter sites? =

Yes, of course! We are working on many more free and pro starter demos.
